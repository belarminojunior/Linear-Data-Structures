# Linear D.S
This repository contains implementations of four common data structures in Java: ArrayList, Queue, Stack, and LinkedList. Each data structure is implemented from scratch to provide a better understanding of their internal workings and to showcase their usage in various scenarios.

## Data Structures
### ArrayList
> The ArrayList is a dynamic array implementation that can dynamically grow or shrink as elements are added or removed. It provides constant-time access to elements and supports dynamic resizing when the underlying array is full. The ArrayList allows insertion, deletion, retrieval, and modification of elements.

### Queue
> The Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. It supports two main operations: enqueue (adding an element to the back) and dequeue (removing an element from the front). The implementation provided here utilizes a LinkedList as the underlying data structure.

### Stack
> The Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. It supports two main operations: push (adding an element to the top) and pop (removing an element from the top). The implementation provided here also utilizes a LinkedList as the underlying data structure.

### LinkedList
> The LinkedList is a linear data structure composed of nodes, where each node holds a reference to the next node in the sequence. It allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position within the list. This implementation provides methods for insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements, as well as other utility operations.
